### Reznick, 2016. Hard and soft selection revisited: How evolution by natural selection works in the real world. Journal of Heredity, 2016, 3 - 14.

##### Haldane and the "classical hypothesis"
- Models assume there is one best genotype (w/ highest fitness)
	- difference between this fitness and (mean) observed fitness is *genetic load*
- Assume that adapting to optimum occurs through slow allelic replacement (one at a time)
	- this is the "classical hypothesis"
	- somehow (?) it follows from this that genetic variation is limited (presumably because it is selected against)
		- although, we know that there is large natural variation

##### Hard versus soft selecton
- Haldane's selection is hard
- Soft selection: environment has vacancies to be filled, w/ genotypes competing to fill them; it will be filled either way
	- this somehow could explain genetic variation...?
	- in a sense these models assume population growth is exponential and ignore resource limitations

##### Guppy example
- Naturally occurring high predation (HP) and low predation (LP) environments
- Predation risk higher for larger individuals
- In HP environments, smaller reproductive individuals, more reproduction
- However, no evidence of age-dependent mortality changing across predator-environments (i.e., no age x predator interaction on mortality)
	- the population ecology (size distribution) explains this: in LP environments, resource stress induced by unproliferated growth not present in HP environments
- Bassar et al., 2010, 2012, 2013, experimentally found that HP guppies have higher fitness than LP at low population density, but not at high density
	- i.e., adaptation to density influences adapting to LP environments, because guppies in LP environments are less sensitive to density
